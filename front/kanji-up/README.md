# Local build on ios

```sh
  # Pass the application from Managed workflow to a bare workflow
  $ yarn eject
```

On the package.json copy this command
```json
  {
    "scripts": {
      "build:ios": "react-native bundle --entry-file='index.js' --bundle-output='./ios/main.jsbundle' --dev=false --assets-dest='ios' --platform='ios'",
    } 
  }
```
It will generate a xcode project, that you have to open to build the application on your phone. Once Xcode openned, click on:

`xcode > Preferences > Accounts > +`

Add an apple ID and generate a certificate.

Then close the Preferences windows and click on the application project to update your application information on the `general` tab.
You'll have then to select your certificate you previously generated by clicking on the `Signing & Capacibilities` tab and on the `Signing` section. You will have an error saying that you can't create an application with this certificate, so to be able to create one, you will have to remove the `Push Notifications` section by clicking on the bin icon.

You'll have to add some file to the build including the assets you are using on this project (images, etc.). By clicking on the `Build phases` tab and on the `Copy bundle Resources` section add the assets and the file named `main.jsbundle`.

You can now build the application and it will show an `Permission error`, from your phone `settings > general > VPN...` you will have to allow your development certificate to be able to access to your application.
